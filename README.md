# AI-Office-Manager

We can all encounter the following problem in the office environment. Who's in the office and who's not. Duties will be distributed, but it is difficult to do this in a crowded environment. We found a solution for this.
- An application that distributes tasks to office members
- Thanks to an IP camera at the entrance of the office, it recognises the faces of the incoming people thanks to AI and it appears in the application that he is in the office. It sends a notification to the application by detecting that the outgoing people leave the office thanks to AI.

-> As the project progresses, we will share the codes and update the system as we develop.
